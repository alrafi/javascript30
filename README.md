Hello, world!

This repository was created to keep me motivated and documenting my journey on JavaScript30 course by wesbos. I will add some notes to this readme based on what I have learnt on this course after I finished the task on that day.

Happy coding!

## Notes
### Day 01: Jul 1, 2019
I have just learnt how to interact with DOM with querySelector, how to handle key event with addEventListener, add some CSS class with javascript, and transition effect on CSS. I also add feature which drum kit can hit not only by keyboard but also with mouse click. Cool!

**Live Demo**: enjoy the drum kit [here](https://alrafi.github.io/javascript30/Day%2001%20-%20Javascript%20Drum%20Kit/).
